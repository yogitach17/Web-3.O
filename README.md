# Web-3.O
MetaLink is a decentralized social networking platform built on Web3 principles, aiming to return data ownership and monetization power to users. By leveraging blockchain technology and decentralized identity (DID) systems, MetaLink allows individuals to connect, share, and interact without the surveillance, censorship.
Through the integration of smart contracts and token economics, users earn $LINK tokens for meaningful contributions—whether it's content creation, engagement, moderation, or development. These tokens can be used to unlock premium features, vote on governance decisions, or trade on decentralized exchanges.

MetaLink uses IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) to store content, ensuring censorship resistance and data permanence. With full support for NFTs, users can mint and trade their digital creations seamlessly within the platform. Privacy, transparency, and autonomy are at the core of every feature.

Core Features:

Decentralized Identity (DID): Users control their identity and data.

Token Rewards System: Earn for engagement, contributions, and content.

On-Chain Governance: Community-led decision making via DAO.

NFT Integration: Create, showcase, and trade NFTs.

Cross-Chain Compatibility: Operates across major blockchains for interoperability.

MetaLink represents the future of social connection—transparent, user-first, and powered by the people.
